Welcome to the SQL module. If data is the lifeblood of our systems, SQL is the beating heart that moves it. This module is an expedition designed to take you from a complete novice to a query-writing expert.

We won't just be reading about syntax; we will be getting our hands dirty. Between these pages, you will find a battery of quizzes and labs, totaling over 200+ queries. We will start small, and by the end, you’ll be solving problems of significant complexity.

## Prerequisites
Before we write our first SELECT statement, we need to make sure our foundation is solid. This module rests heavily on the concepts established in:

- Set Theory
- Dimensional Modeling

We will be using the terminology from those modules freely here. When I mention a "union" or a "star schema," I’m assuming those mental models are already firmly in place. If those concepts feel a little fuzzy, I highly recommend stepping back to review those modules. We have a lot of ground to cover here, and we won't be stopping to re-tread old paths.

## The Practice
Reading code is easy; writing it is where the learning happens. To that end, we have two ways to test your metal.

### Quizzes
Every numbered section wraps up with a 10-question quiz. Think of these as a sanity check. You can take them as many times as you like. There are no grades here—this is simply a tool for you to gauge your comfort with the material. If you can breeze through the quiz, you’re ready for the lab.

### Labs
This is where the rubber meets the road. Every section includes a lab designed to challenge you strictly on what you have learned so far. We believe in fair play; you won't find any "gotcha" questions requiring syntax we haven't covered yet.

You can find the labs in the `/modules/structured_query_language/` folder of the [companion GitHub](https://github.com/OpenConduit/labs). These are designed to run on your local machine, free of charge, because that is where real engineering happens. The repository’s `README` will help you get your environment spun up.
