## Course
This curriculum is designed to take you from abstract mathematical logic to high-performance systems engineering. Unlike many bootcamps that start immediately with syntax, this track follows a "First Principles" approach.

We begin with Set Theory, the mathematical bedrock of all relational databases. Once the logic is sound, we move to Data Modeling, focusing on architectural design and hygiene. With a solid design in place, we master SQL to manipulate that data. Finally, we descend into Database Internals, learning how the engine works under the hood to write queries that are not just correct, but performant.

## The Curriculum
### 1. Set Theory
Status: ✅ Available 

The Mathematical Foundation. Before writing code, we must understand the logic of collections. This module covers sets, elements, and relational algebra—the immutable laws that govern how data is combined, filtered, and retrieved.

### 2. Data Modeling
Status: ✅ Available 

The Architectural Blueprint. Great databases are designed, not guessed. This module focuses on Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, normalization (1NF-3NF), and enforcing integrity. You will learn to structure data efficiently to prevent redundancy and anomalies.

### 3. Structured Query Language (SQL)
Status: ✅ Available 

The Tool of Interaction. This is the practical application of theory. We move from Data Definition (DDL) to advanced Data Querying (DQL), covering joins, aggregations, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to solve complex data problems.

### 4. Database Internals & Optimizations
Status: ✅ Available 

The Engineering Deep Dive. This module separates the users from the engineers. We explore the ACID properties, B-Tree indexing, query planning, and concurrency control to understand exactly how the database engine reads and writes to the disk.
