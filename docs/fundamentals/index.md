## Courses
### 1. Data Engineering 101
Status: ✅ Available 

The Philosophical Map. Before touching a tool, you must understand the territory. This module defines the Data Engineering Lifecycle (Generation, Ingestion, Storage, Serving) and the core mandate of the profession: reliability. We explore the critical architectural distinctions between OLTP and OLAP workloads.

### 2. Systems Architecture
Status: 🚧 Under Development

The Hardware Reality. Data does not live in the "cloud"; it lives on physical hardware governed by physics. This module covers the Von Neumann architecture, the Memory Hierarchy (Latency numbers), and the physical constraints of Disk I/O that dictate all future performance tuning.

### 3. Linux Internals
Status: 🚧 Under Development

The Operating Environment. You cannot engineer data if you cannot control the server it lives on. Moving beyond simple Bash scripting, this module focuses on the OS as a resource manager: navigating the filesystem, managing processes, understanding permissions, and debugging resource contention.

### 4. Git for Ops & Engineering
Status: 🚧 Under Development

The Governance Layer. In Data Engineering, version control is the backbone of reliability. This module focuses on Git not just for code, but for infrastructure auditing, safe collaboration, and configuration management.
