You understand the mathematical foundation of data (Set Theory). Now, we leave the abstract world of logic and enter the concrete world of infrastructure.

If "Data Science" is the art of finding answers, Data Engineering is the art of building the systems that make those answers possible. Without reliable pipelines, the most sophisticated machine learning model is useless.

This module is a comprehensive survey of the modern data landscape. We will dismantle the "black boxes" of the industry—Kafka, Snowflake, Airflow—and arrange them onto a clear mental map. You will stop seeing these tools as isolated buzzwords and start seeing them as interchangeable components in a unified lifecycle.

The goal is not just to learn how to write a pipeline, but to understand the physics of data movement: why latency exists, why distributed systems fail, and how to build reliability into an unreliable world.

## Prerequisites
No prerequisites. Let's get started!

## Quizzes
Every numbered section wraps up with a 10-question quiz. Think of these as a sanity check. You can take them as many times as you like. There are no grades here—this is simply a tool for you to gauge whether your mental model matches the reality. If you can breeze through the quiz, you are ready to move on.

## A Note on Labs
