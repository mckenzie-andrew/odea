You can write SQL, you can optimize a Python script, and you can spin up a Spark cluster. But when the job is slow, do you know why? When the database hangs, do you know what the disk is doing? When the network times out, do you understand the packet flow?

This course peels back the layers of abstraction. We stop pretending that the Cloud is a fluffy nebula of infinite resources and admit what it really is: **a collection of physical machines with physical limits.**

## Prerequisites
Ideally, you should have completed "Data Engineering 101," before moving forward.

## Quizzes
Every numbered section wraps up with a 10-question quiz. Think of these as a sanity check. You can take them as many times as you like. There are no grades here—this is simply a tool for you to gauge whether your mental model matches the reality. If you can breeze through the quiz, you are ready to move on.
